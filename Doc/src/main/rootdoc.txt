Scalaxy/Reify provides a powerful reified values mechanism that deals well with composition and captures of runtime values, allowing for complex ASTs to be generated during runtime for re-compilation or transformation purposes. 

It preserves the original value that was reified, allowing for flexible mixed usage of runtime value and compile-time AST.

Please look at documentation of [[scalaxy.reified.reify]] and [[scalaxy.reified.Reified]] first.

{{{
import scalaxy.reified._

def comp(capture1: Int): ReifiedFunction1[Int, Int] = {
  val capture2 = Seq(10, 20, 30)
  val f = reify((x: Int) => capture1 + capture2(x))
  val g = reify((x: Int) => x * x)
  
  // Same as reify((x: Int) => g(f(x))):
  g.compose(f)
}

val f = comp(10)
// Normal evaluation, using regular function:
println(f(1))

// Get the function's AST, inlining all captured values and captured reified values:
val ast = f.expr().tree
println(ast) 

// Compile the AST at runtime.
// This is an optimized compilation by default, with some Scalaxy/Reified-specific AST rewrites
// and soon other optimizations taken from Scalaxy.
val compiledF = ast.compile()()
// Evaluation, using the freshly-compiled function:
println(compiledF(1))
